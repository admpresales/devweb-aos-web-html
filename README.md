# devweb-aos-web-html

This DevWeb sample follows the DevWeb video tutorial 4 and creates a DevWeb script for VuGen by running the DevWeb offline code generator
from the nimbusserver.aos.com.har file that was created in Chrome. The resulting DevWeb output was then loaded into VuGen and
edited to create a VuGen script that verifies a response body and prints All is good.
